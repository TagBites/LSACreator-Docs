## What is it

LSACreator is the simple but powerful .NET localization tool and the fastest solution for localizing .NET applications and ASP.NET websites without need to use Visual Studio.

The solution is based on localized satellite assemblies which is the best practice to make a professional .NET multi-language application. Thanks to this approach we can add a new language to any .NET program or website having only its binaries (.dll/.exe). That completely separates Visual Studio project and source code from language project. What is more it even allows end-user to translate the application.

See the [Quick start](docs/quickstart.md) for more details.
